</br>
Jurisdictional Issues.  The Service is controlled and operated by Musical.ly from its offices in the State of California and the People’s Republic of China.  Musical.ly makes no representation that materials on the Service are appropriate, lawful or available for use in any locations other than the United States of America.

</br>
The Service.</br>
</br>
Description.  Subject to Musical.ly’s potential blocking of certain content owned or controlled by the third parties, which blocking you hereby authorize, the Service enables you to create 15-second videos that incorporate locally stored sound recordings from your personal music library (each, a “UGV”) and also allows you to extract all or any portion of the User Content (defined in Section 5.a below) incorporated into any UGV created by another user to produce collaborative UGVs that combine and intersperse User Content from UGVs generated by more than one user (each, a “Collaborative UGV”).  Any person who creates a UGV will be referred to herein as a “Creator,” and any person who uses any User Content from another’s UGV to create a Collaborative UGV as permitted by this EULA will be referred to herein as an “Editor.”  Creators, Editors and all other users of the Service will be referred to herein collectively as “Users.”  </br>
</br>
In addition to allowing you to create UGVs and Collaborative UGVs, the Service also allows you to (i) create 15-second videos that include sound recording samples (and the musical works embodied therein) (“SR Samples”) made available by Musical.ly through the Service through a Musical.ly-provided library (each, a “Musical.ly Video,” together with UGVs and Collaborative UGVs, “User Videos”); (ii) save your User Videos locally to your device; (iii) upload your User Videos to the App or certain social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Vine, Twitter) subject to the terms and conditions in this EULA and any usage restrictions imposed by any licensors of SR Samples (both the sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein); (iv) communicate your User Videos to friends via different messaging services; and (v) publicly display and perform your User Videos and the embedded sound recordings and musical works to other Users of the Service.</br>  
</br>
Private Accounts.  You control whether the User Videos you create are made publicly available on the Service or only available to people you approve.  To restrict access to your User Videos, you should elect “private account” in the settings page within the App.</br>
</br>
Mobile Services.  The Service will be accessible via a mobile phone, tablet or other wireless device (collectively, “Mobile Services”).  Your mobile carrier’s normal messaging, data, and other rates and fees will apply to your use of the Mobile Services.  In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.  Therefore, you are solely responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile device(s), what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you.  Nevertheless, all use of the App and the related Mobile Services must be in accordance with this EULA.</br>
</br>
Registration.</br>
</br>
Log-In Credentials.  While you may always browse the public-facing portions of the Service without registering with us, in order to enjoy the full benefits of the Service, including to serve as a Creator or Editor, you must download the App and register an account with us (an “Account”).You may register using your email address or your Facebook or Twitter credentials.</br>       
</br>
Account Security.  You are responsible for the security of your Account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur through the use of your credentials.  You will notify Musical.ly immediately at privacy@musical.ly if you suspect or know of any unauthorized use of your log-in credentials or any other breach of security with respect to your Account.  Musical.ly will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your credentials prior to you notifying Musical.ly of such unauthorized use or loss of your credentials.  Separate log-in credentials may be required to access External Sites (defined in Section 7 below).</br>
</br>
Accuracy of Information.  When creating an Account, you will provide true, accurate, current, and complete information as Musical.ly requests.  You will update the information about yourself promptly, and as necessary, to keep it current and accurate.  We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove, or reassign certain usernames and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your Account if activities occur on your Account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of this EULA, cause damage to or impair the Service, infringe or violate any third party rights, or violate any applicable laws or regulations.  If messages sent to the e-mail address you provide are returned as undeliverable, then Musical.ly may terminate your Account immediately without notice to you and without any liability to you or any third party.</br>  
</br>
Messages.  You may send messages to Users through the App.  You represent and warrant you will only send messages through the App to Users who have given you their express consent to receive such messages, and you will indemnify and hold Musical.ly harmless from any and all claims arising out of your sending these messages to any Users.  You are responsible for all fees and charges associated with such messages.</br> 
</br>
Intellectual Property Rights</br>
</br>
License.  Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with this EULA, Musical.ly hereby grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free and worldwide right and license to access and use the Service solely for your personal, non-commercial use and solely in strict compliance with the provisions of this EULA.  NO RIGHTS ARE LICENSED WITH RESPECT TO SOUND RECORDINGS AND THE MUSICAL WORKS EMBODIED THEREIN THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE FROM ANY MUSICAL.LY PROVIDED LIBRARY OF CONTENT.</br>
</br>
Covenant Not to Sue.  Musical.ly, on behalf of itself and any third party licensors of sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein) that are made available directly to you by Musical.ly through any Musical.ly-provided library of music, hereby represents, warrants, and covenants that it will not, for so long as you are authorized to use the Service pursuant to this EULA, sue or bring a cause of action against you for:</br> 
</br>
Reproducing SR Samples in timed relation to visual images (i.e., synchronizing) in User Videos created in strict compliance with this EULA, provided you are using only an SR Sample provided by Musical.ly and not any sound recordings, musical works, or other User Videos uploaded by you or others to the Service; and </br>
</br>
Reproducing a User Video embodying an SR Sample on your own mobile device or distributing such User Video with private or public audiences via the Service, provided such distribution is in strict compliance with this EULA and the functionalities of the App.</br>
</br>
User-Sourced Sound Recordings and Musical Works.  Nothing in this EULA grants you a license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, communicate to the public, synchronize or otherwise use and exploit any sound recordings or musical works obtained by you from any source other than a Musical.ly provided library.  You are solely responsible for clearing the rights to any sound recordings and musical works you source directly.</br>  
</br>
No Modification Rights.  Nothing in this EULA authorizes you to modify, change, or adapt the lyrics or fundamental character of any musical work or sound recording and any such modifications, changes or adaptations may subject you to third party claims.  You are solely responsible for obtaining any necessary rights, clearances, permissions or authorizations to modify, change or adopt any third party content.</br>
</br>
Third Party Consent for Collaborative UGVs.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that if you (i) desire to upload (“Post”) a Collaborative UGV to any External Sites; or (ii) use a Collaborative UGV for any commercial purpose, then, in each case, you must obtain the prior consent from each Creator whose User Content you incorporated into the applicable Collaborative UGV through the functionality available on the Service.  For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, “commercial purpose” means any purpose that may directly or indirectly generate income, revenue, good will or any other tangible or intangible benefit.</br>  
</br>
Content.  Except for User Content, the content that Musical.ly provides to Users on or through the Service, including without limitation, any SR Samples, text, graphics, photos, software, and interactive features, is protected by copyright or other intellectual property rights and owned by Musical.ly or its third party licensors (collectively, the “Musical.ly Content”).  Moreover, Musical.ly solely owns all design rights, databases and compilation and other intellectual property rights in and to the Service, in each case whether registered or unregistered, and any related goodwill.</br>  
</br>
Marks.  The Musical.ly trademarks, service marks, and logos (the “Musical.ly Trademarks”) used and displayed on the Service are Musical.ly’s registered and unregistered trademarks or service marks.  Other product and service names located on the Service may be trademarks or service marks owned by third parties (the “Third-Party Trademarks,” and, collectively with the Musical.ly Trademarks, the “Trademarks”).  Except as otherwise permitted by law, you may not use the Trademarks to disparage Musical.ly or the applicable third-party, Musical.ly’s or a third-party’s products or services, or in any manner (using commercially reasonable judgment) that may damage any goodwill in the Trademarks.  You may not use any Trademarks as part of a link to or from any Service without Musical.ly’s prior express written consent.  All goodwill generated from the use of any Musical.ly Trademark will inure solely to Musical.ly’s benefit.</br>  
</br>
Restrictions.  Musical.ly hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this Section 4.  Accordingly, nothing this EULA or on the Service will be construed as granting to you, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any additional license rights in and to the Service or any Musical.ly Content or Trademarks located or displayed there in.</br> 
</br> 
User Content. 
</br>
Definition.  “User Content” means any content that Users upload, post or transmit (collectively, “Post”) to or through the Service including, without limitation, any text, photographs, User Videos or sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein and any other works subject to protection under the laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, and excludes any and all Musical.ly Content (including, without limitation, any SR Samples incorporated into Musical.ly Videos).</br> 
</br> 
Screening User Content.  Musical.ly offers Users the ability to submit User Content to the Service.  Musical.ly does not pre-screen any User Content, but reserves the right to remove or delete any User Content in its sole discretion.  In addition, we have the right – but not the obligation – in our sole discretion to remove or delete any User Content (i) that we consider to violate this EULA, applicable law or otherwise constitute Objectionable Content (defined in Section 5.i below); or (ii) in response to complaints from other Users.  As a result, we recommend that you save copies of any User Content that you Post to the Service on your personal device(s) in the event that you want to ensure that you have access to copies such User Content.  Musical.ly does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and under no circumstances will Musical.ly be liable in any way for any User Content.</br>   
</br> 
Intellectual Property Rights.  SUBJECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS IN ANY PREEXISTING CONTENT INCLUDED WITHIN YOUR USER CONTENT, INCLUDING MUSICAL.LY CONTENT, YOU RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE IN YOUR USER CONTENT AND SUBMITTING YOUR USER CONTENT TO THE SERVICE DOES NOT TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF YOUR RIGHTS.</br>  
</br> 
Licenses to User Content.  You hereby grant Musical.ly an unrestricted, assignable, sublicensable, revocable, royalty-free license throughout the universe to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, communicate to the public, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), make available, create derivative works from, retransmit from External Sites, and otherwise exploit and use (collectively, “Use”) all User Content you Post to or through the Service by any means and through any media and formats now known or hereafter developed, for the purposes of (i) advertising, marketing, and promoting Musical.ly and the Service; (ii) displaying and sharing your User Content to other Users of the Service; (iii) providing the Service as authorized by this EULA; and (iv) sublicensing Editors the appropriate rights to enable them to create Collaborative UGVs that incorporate any of your User Content.  If you terminate this EULA or remove any of your User Content from the Service after it has been included within a Collaborative UGV, then your license grant with respect to your User Content included within such Collaborative UGV is perpetual and irrevocable.  You further grant Musical.ly a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content. You must not post any User Content on or through the Service or transmit to Musical.ly any User Content that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.  Any User Content posted by you to or through the Service or transmitted to Musical.ly will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary, and treated as such by Musical.ly, and may be used by Musical.ly in accordance with this EULA without notice to you and without any liability to Musical.ly.  For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding sentences of this Section include, but are not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis.  This means that you are granting Company the right to Use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a “PRO”), a sound recording PRO (e.g., SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation of User Content.</br>   
</br> 
You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post.  You must not Post any User Content to the Service if you are not the copyright owner of or are not fully authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of the User Content you intend to Post to the Service.  In addition, if you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not Post such sound recordings to the Service unless you have all necessary rights, authorizations, and permissions with respect to such embedded musical works that grant you sufficient rights to grant the licenses to Company under these Terms.  You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User Content Posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms; (ii) the Posting and Use of your User Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights, or any other rights of any person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person visible in any of your User Content; (iii) the Posting of your User Content on the Service will not require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and (iv) the Posting of your User Content on the Service does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party.  You agree to pay all monies owing to any person as a result of Posting your User Content on the Service.</br>   
</br> 
Specific Rules for Musical Works.  If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through this EULA to us.  You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations.  If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in this EULA or have such music publisher enter into this Agreement with us.  Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the licenses in this EULA.</br>  
</br> 
Through-To-The-Audience Rights.  All of the rights you grant in this EULA are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of External Sites will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or Used on such External Sites via the Service.</br> 
</br> 
Waiver of Rights to User Content.  By Posting User Content to or through the Service, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content.  You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof.  To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you Post to or through the Service.</br>  
</br> 
Objectionable Content.  You agree not to Post any User Content to the Service that is or could be interpreted to be infringing, defamatory, libelous, inaccurate, unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, vulgar, offensive, obscene, pornographic, objectionable, hateful, or promoting discrimination, bigotry, racism, or hatred, as Musical.ly may determine in its sole discretion (collectively, “Objectionable Content”).  You also agree not to use the Service for illegal or unlawful purposes, including, without limitation, to stalk any other User.  If you encounter any Objectionable Content on the Service, then please email Musical.ly at legal@musical.ly or inform us through the functionality offered on the Service. You acknowledge and agree that Musical.ly provides you the right to report Objectionable Content as a courtesy, and Musical.ly has no obligation to remove or take any other action with respect to any Objectionable Content on the Service that you report to us.</br> 
</br> 
No Liability.  For the avoidance of doubt, Musical.ly will not be liable for any unauthorized use of User Content by any User.</br>  
</br>

If you choose to contribute by sending Musical.ly or our employees any ideas for products, services, features, modifications, enhancements, content, refinements, technologies, content offerings (such as audio, visual, games, or other types of content), promotions, strategies, or product/feature names, or any related documentation, artwork, computer code, diagrams, or other materials (collectively “Feedback”), then regardless of what your accompanying communication may say, the following terms will apply, so that future misunderstandings can be avoided.

</br> 
Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements.</br>   
</br> 
Respect of Third Party Rights.  Musical.ly respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Users to do the same.  Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service. </br> 
</br> 
Repeat Infringer Policy.  Musical.ly’s intellectual property policy is to (i) remove or disable access to material that Musical.ly believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (ii) remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by “repeat infringers.”  Musical.ly considers a “repeat infringer” to be any User that has uploaded User Content or Feedback to or through the Service and for whom Musical.ly has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content or Feedback.  Musical.ly has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Musical.ly’s own determination. </br>  
</br> 
Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.  If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below.  Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Musical.ly with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you hereby consent to Musical.ly making such disclosure.  Your communication must include substantially the following:</br>   
</br> 
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed; 
Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works;</br>  
</br> 
Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Musical.ly to locate the material;</br>  
</br> 
Information reasonably sufficient to permit Musical.ly to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;</br>  
</br> 
A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; </br>  
</br> 
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</br>   
</br> 
You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.  </br>

</br> 
A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</br>   
</br> 
Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.  If you submit a Counter Notification to Musical.ly in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, Musical.ly will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Musical.ly will replace the removed User Content or Feedback or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Musical.ly will replace the removed User Content or Feedback and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Musical.ly’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Musical.ly’s system or network.</br> 
</br> 
False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.  The Copyright Act provides that:</br>  
[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [Musical.ly] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.  
17 U.S.C. § 512(f).</br>   
</br> 
Musical.ly reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.</br>   
</br> 
Dispute Resolution.</br> 
</br> 
Mandatory Arbitration.  Please read this carefully.  It affects your rights.  MUSICAL.LY (AND ITS RESPECTIVE CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, PERMITTED ASSIGNS), YOU AND ANY OTHER PARTIES ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE SERVICE AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS EULA OR THE SERVICE.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  Please visit www.adr.org for more information.</br> 
</br> 
Commencing Arbitration.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by a reputable courier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Musical.ly, to you via any other method available to Musical.ly, including via e-mail.  The Notice to Musical.ly should be addressed to 1161 Mission Street, Office #502, San Francisco, CA 94103, Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the “Arbitration Notice Address”).  The Notice must (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific relief sought (the “Demand”).  If you and Musical.ly do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Musical.ly may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court.  THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (“Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS EULA.  The Rules and AAA forms are available at http://www.adr.org.  If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against Musical.ly, then Musical.ly will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Musical.ly’s receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than U.S.$1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.</br> 
</br> 
Arbitration Proceeding.  The arbitration will be conducted in English.  A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in San Francisco County, California will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein.  You and Musical.ly agree the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</br>   
</br> 
No Class Actions.  YOU AND MUSICAL.LY AGREE THAT YOU AND MUSICAL.LY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID. </br>  
</br> 
Decision of the Arbitrator.  Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.  The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice.  All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.  The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.  The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration.  You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.  The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in this EULA. </br>  
</br> 
Equitable Relief.  The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party’s copyrights, trademarks, or patents.  You acknowledge that, in the event Musical.ly or a third party breaches this EULA, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Musical.ly, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this EULA.</br>   
</br> 
Claims.  You and Musical.ly agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.  Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. </br>  
</br> 
Improperly Filed Claims.  All claims you bring against Musical.ly must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section.  All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section will be considered improperly filed.  Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, Musical.ly may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that Musical.ly has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</br> 
</br> 
Modifications.  In the event that Musical.ly makes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration provision (other than a change to Musical.ly’s Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Musical.ly’s Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with Musical.ly and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Dispute Resolution provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this EULA.</br>   
</br> 
Enforceability.  If only Section 10.a.iii or the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 will govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.</br>   
</br> 
Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties.</br>   
</br> 
a. MUSICAL.LY, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “MUSICAL.LY PARTIES”) MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED, TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS APPROPRIATENESS, TIMELINESS OR RELIABILITY THEREOF.

d.

MUSICAL.LY’S LIABILITY, AND THE LIABILITY OF ANY OTHER MUSICAL.LY PARTIES, TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO U.S.$100.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IN SUCH STATES, THE LIABILITY OF THE MUSICAL.LY PARTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</br>

ANY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE AND NOT LIMITATION, ANY CARRIER, COPYRIGHT OWNER OR OTHER USER, IS DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOU AND SUCH THIRD PARTY, AND YOU IRREVOCABLY RELEASE THE MUSICAL.LY PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. </br>

In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Musical.ly’s defense of such matter at your expense.</br>
